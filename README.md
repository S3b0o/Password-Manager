PASSWORD MANAGER, created by Seb./Seb0o.
A simple Password Manager made in python.

The password manager contains an option
to create accounts, log into the accounts,
save passwords, encrypt and decrypt passwords
and generate new and secure passwords.

----------------------------------------------------

Note: The program might be seen
as a virus, but it is completely safe.
The reason it might be seen as a virus,
is because does not have a high number
of downloads, and it does not have
a license, which is why windows
might see it as a virus.

When you launch the program you will
be prompted with a setup installation.
The installation will ask you if you
want to install using admin privileges
or not. If you choose to download with
admin privileges the program will be
installed inside your program files
folder. If you do not choose to install
using admin, the program will install
within your appdata/local/programs folder.
There will be no difference in the program
no matter what type of installation you choose.

You won't need to do anything else once
the setup installation is done. The
program will then be installed and
ready to use.

----------------------------------------------------

If you keep the generated and encrypted
passwords, but you uninstall the program,
your passwords will be lost even if you
download the program and log into your
account again. So be sure that when
you uninstall the program you have
retrieved your passwords and saved
them somewhere else.
